# quakec-nanorc
A tiny repo for a nanorc file with quakec syntax highlighting

##Setup
Copy the .nanorc file into your /usr/share/nano/ directory and it should just work. If you know enough to be installing nano on a platform without a /usr/share/nano/ directory, you know more about your own setup than I do and can figure it out.
